```

## Firebase Setup

The app expects an existing Firebase project. Core config lives in `firebase.ts`:

- Auth (Email/Password, Google; Apple on iOS)
- Firestore for user data and domain models
- Storage for profile images

Checklist:

1. Enable Authentication providers
   - Email/Password
   - Google: configure OAuth client IDs and SHA‑1 for Android; set `webClientId` where used in auth context
   - Apple (iOS): enable provider and configure in Apple Developer and Firebase
2. Firestore
   - Create database; set security rules according to your needs
3. Storage
   - Ensure bucket exists; apply suitable security rules (see `storage.rules`)

Sensitive keys are currently in `firebase.ts`. For production, move secrets to secure env handling.

## Services Architecture

Domain‑focused services under `services/` provide clean APIs and real‑time subscriptions:

- AccountService: initialize defaults, CRUD, balances, subscribe
- CategoryService: defaults, CRUD, search, filters
- TransactionService: create/update/delete with balance effects, queries, subscribe
- GoalService: CRUD, payTowardGoal, completion, progress helpers

See `services/README.md` for function lists and usage examples.

## Profile Image Feature

- Component: `components/ProfileImagePicker.tsx`
- Service: `services/UserProfileService.ts`
- Storage path: `profile-images/profile_{userId}_{timestamp}.jpg`
- Flow: pick/capture → validate → upload → get URL → update Firestore → update UI
- Drawer integration displays uploaded image or generated initials

Refer to `PROFILE_IMAGE_FEATURE.md` for UX details and troubleshooting.

## Running Locally

Prerequisites:

- Node.js LTS, Yarn or npm
- Expo CLI and Android Studio (for device/emulator)

Install and start:

```powershell
# From repo root
npm install
npm run start

# Android
npm run android

# Web (for limited development purposes)
npm run web
```

If using EAS builds locally, install the Expo Dev Client and follow prompts.

## Building an APK (EAS)

EAS profiles (`eas.json`) are preconfigured for APK outputs:

- development: internal distribution, dev client, APK
- preview: internal distribution, APK
- production: autoIncrement, APK

Common steps:

1. Install EAS CLI: `npm install -g eas-cli`
2. Login: `eas login`
3. Configure: `eas build:configure`
4. Build APK:
   - Dev/Preview: `eas build -p android --profile preview`
   - Production: `eas build -p android --profile production`

After build completes, download the APK from the EAS dashboard or artifact URL and optionally upload to Google Drive to share.

## Screens and Navigation

Expo Router organizes screens under `app/`:

- Auth: `(auth)/login.tsx`, `(auth)/signup.tsx`
- Account: `(account)/account.tsx`
- Categories: `(categories)/`
- Dashboard: `(dashboard)/dashboard.tsx`
- Transactions: `(transaction)/` including `add`, `edit/[id]`, `index`, and details `[id]`
- Settings/Help/Goal/History/GetStarted flows

Shared components like `TransactionList`, `TransactionForm`, `NavigationDrawer`, and `AppHeader` provide a consistent UI.

## Security Notes

- Use proper Firestore and Storage security rules for user‑scoped data
- Avoid committing secrets; rotate keys when sharing APKs publicly
- Consider enabling email verification and MFA for production

## Troubleshooting

- Google sign‑in errors on Android
  - Ensure SHA‑1 fingerprint is added to Firebase and Google Cloud console
  - Verify `webClientId` matches your OAuth client
- Storage upload fails
  - Confirm Storage bucket exists and rules permit user uploads
  - Check Android permissions for camera/media
- App doesn’t start on device
  - Clear Metro cache and reinstall app; ensure matching SDK versions
